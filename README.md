### Run coding agents the right way

Run agents locally, in worktrees, in background - without touching main branch.

- **Git Worktree Isolation** - Each chat session runs in its own isolated worktree
- **Background Execution** - Run agents in background while you continue working
- **Local-first** - All code stays on your machine, no cloud sync required
- **Branch Safety** - Never accidentally commit to main branch
- **Shared Terminals** - Share terminal sessions across local-mode workspaces

Cursor-like UI with diff previews, built-in git client, and the ability to see changes before they land.

- **Diff Previews** - See exactly what changes the agent is making in real-time
- **Built-in Git Client** - Stage, commit, push to GitHub, and manage branches without leaving the app
- **Git Activity Badges** - See git operations directly on agent messages
- **Rollback** - Roll back changes from any user message bubble
- **Real-time Tool Execution** - See bash commands, file edits, and web searches as they happen
- **File Viewer** - File preview with Cmd+P search, syntax highlighting, and image viewer
- **Chat Forking** - Fork a sub-chat from any assistant message to explore alternatives
- **Chat Export** - Export conversations for sharing or archival
- **File Mentions** - Reference files directly in chat with @ mentions
- **Message Queue** - Queue up prompts while an agent is working

### Plan mode that actually helps you think

The agent asks clarifying questions, builds structured plans, and shows clean markdown preview - all before execution.

- **Clarifying Questions** - The agent asks what it needs to know before starting
- **Structured Plans** - See step-by-step breakdown of what will happen
- **Clean Markdown Preview** - Review plans in readable format
- **Review Before Execution** - Approve or modify the plan before the agent acts
- **Extended Thinking** - Enabled by default with visual thinking gradient
- **Sub-agents** - Visual task list for sub-agents in the details sidebar

### Background agents that never sleep

Close your laptop. Your agents keep running in isolated cloud sandboxes with live browser previews.

- **Runs When You Sleep** - Background agents continue working even when your laptop is closed
- **Cloud Sandboxes** - Every background session runs in an isolated cloud environment
- **Live Browser Previews** - See your dev branch running in a real browser

- **Rich Tool Display** - See MCP tool calls with formatted inputs and outputs
- **@ Mentions** - Reference MCP servers directly in chat input

### Automations that work while you sleep

- **@maestro Triggers** - Tag @maestro in GitHub, Linear, or Slack to start agents
- **Git Event Triggers** - Run automations on push, PR, or any git event
- **Conditions & Filters** - Control when automations fire
- **Execution Timeline** - Visual history of past runs

## API

Run coding agents programmatically. Point at a repo, give it a task - the agent runs in a sandbox and delivers a PR.

- **Remote Sandboxes** - Isolated cloud environment, repo cloned, dependencies installed
- **Git & PR Integration** - Agent commits, pushes branches, opens PRs automatically
- **Async Execution** - Fire and forget, poll for status or get notified
- **Follow-up Messages** - Send additional instructions to a running task

## Installation

### Build from source

```bash
# Prerequisites: Bun, Python, Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows) or Xcode CLI (macOS)
bun install
npx electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3 -o better-sqlite3  # Windows only
bun run claude:download  # Download Claude binary (required!)
bun run build
bun run package:win  # or package:mac, package:linux
```

> **Important:** The `claude:download` step downloads the Claude CLI binary which is required for the agent chat to work.

## Development

```bash
bun install
npx electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3 -o better-sqlite3  # Windows only
bun run claude:download  # First time only
bun run dev
```
